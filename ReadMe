working on: LSTM Forecasting Pipeline Design
1. Data Preparation and Windowing
Time-series models like LSTMs require fixed-length sequences as input. To build these, transform the merged dataset into overlapping “sliding windows” of past values. For example, for a window length N, each training sample would consist of features for time steps t – N, …, t–1 with the target at t. In practice this means reshaping your DataFrame into a 3D tensor of shape (num_samples, N, num_features). Typical code uses a loop or array-striding to create input windows and matching labels one day ahead. The exact window length N is a hyperparameter: too small and the model sees only short-term patterns; too large and it may overfit or waste capacity. We recommend experimenting with multiple values (e.g. 10, 20, 30 days) and choosing by cross-validation performance. Stock data have uneven calendars (weekends, holidays). A common approach is to align sequences on trading days only and simply skip non-trading gaps. In practice, first reindex your data at a daily or business-day frequency, forward-filling (or otherwise imputing) missing values so each “day” has a complete feature vector. For example, you might carry forward the last known price/return on a holiday so the LSTM sees a continuous sequence of daily features. An alternative is to explicitly encode time gaps (e.g. as a “days since last trade” feature), but in our case it is simpler to use only trading-day values and treat each step as “one day” uniformly. Be careful with features like volatility or sentiment: if they are computed weekly, convert them to daily or forward-fill them so the window aligns. Always ensure the same index is used for all features so that each window represents the same dates for all inputs. All numeric features should be scaled before LSTM training. Neural networks train faster and converge more reliably when inputs have similar scales

. Common choices are standardization (subtract mean, divide by standard deviation) or normalization (min-max to [0,1]). Use scikit-learn’s StandardScaler or MinMaxScaler. For example, fit the scaler on the training set only (to avoid peeking at future data), then apply the same transformation to validation and test sets. This ensures consistent treatment of input scales across training and inference. In financial series, outliers can occur (e.g. sudden price jumps), so robust scaling (e.g. quantile transform) or clipping might be considered if outliers are extreme. If features have meaningful units (e.g. returns vs volatility), you may scale each feature column separately. Store the scaler parameters (mean, std, min, max) as part of the model pipeline so new data in production is normalized identically.
Sliding windows: Build inputs (t–N … t–1) → (target at t) for each stock. Experiment with window sizes, guided by autocorrelation or cross-validation.
Calendar alignment: Use a uniform trading-day index, forward-fill or impute missing values on weekends/holidays so windows remain contiguous. Optionally include a binary “market open” flag or day-of-week encoding if irregular spacing matters.
Scaling: Scale each numeric feature (returns, volume, volatility, sentiment, etc.) to comparable ranges

. Fit scalers on training data and reuse on validation/test to avoid data leakage.
2. LSTM Architecture Design
The LSTM should be relatively simple, given limited financial data. A typical starting design is 1–2 stacked LSTM layers followed by a dense output. Stacking LSTM layers can increase modeling capacity: each layer learns higher-level sequence features
machinelearningmastery.com
. For example, you might use two LSTM layers (the first with return_sequences=True, the second without) before a Dense output. However, deeper networks risk overfitting, especially on noisy stock data, so start shallow and only add layers if needed. Bidirectional LSTMs are not recommended for forecasting, since they use future context; we only train on past data, so use unidirectional LSTMs. Choose the number of units (hidden size) based on data size. A common range is 50–200 units per layer. More units can capture complex patterns but also overfit. You might start with ~50–100 units in the first layer and, if stacked, fewer in the second (e.g. 50→25). Use the default tanh activation inside LSTM cells and sigmoid gates (these are built-in). For the final output layer (predicting the return or price), use a linear activation (no nonlinearity) if doing regression. Apply dropout for regularization. Keras allows dropout (on inputs) and recurrent_dropout (on recurrent state) in LSTM layers. Typical values are 0.1–0.3; e.g. dropout=0.2, recurrent_dropout=0.2. This helps prevent overfitting to short patterns. Also consider Layer Normalization or Batch Normalization if very deep, but usually modest dropout suffices. Decide between many-to-one (output final state) vs many-to-many (output full sequence). For single-step forecasting, set return_sequences=False on the last LSTM and output one value. For multi-step forecasting (see next section), you have two options: either use the model iteratively, or design it to output multiple steps. In the latter case, set return_sequences=True on the last LSTM and attach a TimeDistributed(Dense(output_dim)) to predict each future step at once. This direct multi-output approach avoids some compounding error but requires training data with multi-step targets. Loss function: MSE (mean squared error) is the default for regression, but stock returns can have outliers. A robust alternative is Huber loss, which is quadratic for small errors but linear for large errors. Recent work shows that LSTMs trained with Huber are more resilient to extreme events in financial data
researchgate.net
. In practice, try both: Huber (with δ tuned) can improve stability, while MSE may fit more tightly if outliers are rare. Optimizer: Adam is a good default for RNNs. Use a small learning rate (e.g. 0.001 or 0.0005) to start. Adam’s default beta1=0.9, beta2=0.999 usually works well for time-series
ojs.wiserpub.com
. You can also try RMSprop (designed for RNNs) or SGD with Nesterov momentum for comparison. Always use learning rate scheduling (e.g. ReduceLROnPlateau) or manual decay if the training loss plateaus. Monitor convergence carefully, as RNNs can be slow to train.
Layers: 1–2 LSTM layers (stacked LSTM) are often enough
machinelearningmastery.com
. Avoid bidirectional layers for forecasting.
Units: 50–200 hidden units; tune based on capacity vs data size. More units = more expressiveness but risk overfitting.
Dropout: Use input/recurrent dropout (~0.1–0.3) for regularization.
Output: For one-step, output final state; for multi-step, either iterate or set return_sequences=True and use a TimeDistributed output.
Loss: Start with MSE; consider Huber loss to reduce sensitivity to large price moves
researchgate.net
.
Optimizer: Adam (LR ~1e-3) or RMSProp are standard. Include learning-rate decay or early reduction.
3. Training Strategy
Avoid data leakage by splitting chronologically. For example, use the earliest 60–70% of the data for training, the next 10–20% for validation, and the final chunk for testing. Do not shuffle time order. You can also use walk-forward (expanding window) cross-validation: e.g. train on 2015–2018, validate on 2019; then train on 2015–2019, validate on 2020; etc. Scikit-learn’s TimeSeriesSplit is a convenient way to generate such splits automatically
datascience.stackexchange.com
. This ensures the model is only ever tested on future data it hasn’t seen, preventing lookahead bias. Choose a reasonable batch size. LSTM training usually works with moderate batch sizes (e.g. 32, 64, or 128). Smaller batches (like 32) introduce more noise which can regularize, but too small (e.g. 1) may slow learning. If using stateful LSTM (carrying state across batches), you might use batch size = sequence length, but that is advanced and often unnecessary. For simplicity use stateless batches (shuffle=False). Use early stopping: monitor validation loss (or a relevant metric, e.g. MAE or directional accuracy) and stop training when it stops improving. A patience of 5–10 epochs is common. Also save the best model weights on validation performance. This prevents overfitting to the training set. For stability, you can also use learning-rate schedules (e.g. reduce LR on plateau by half if val loss doesn’t improve in 3–5 epochs). Hyperparameter tuning: Key hyperparameters include the window size N, number of LSTM layers, units per layer, dropout rates, learning rate, and loss function. Best practice is to tune these on the validation set. You might do a coarse search (e.g. grid or randomized) over plausible values, then refine. For example: try window lengths of 10, 20, 30; learning rates {1e-3, 5e-4, 1e-4}; hidden units {50, 100, 150}. Tools like Keras Tuner or scikit-learn’s GridSearchCV (with a custom train/val split generator) can help automate this. Always keep the test set completely untouched until final evaluation.
Splitting: Use time-based splits; e.g. train on oldest data, validate on middle, test on newest. Consider TimeSeriesSplit to formalize this
datascience.stackexchange.com
.
Batch size: Typically 32–128. Ensure shuffle=False for time order. If memory permits, smaller batches can improve generalization.
Early stopping: Stop when validation loss stops improving, to avoid overfitting.
Hyperparam tuning: Tune window length, network depth/width, dropout, learning rate, and loss. Use a validation set or backtesting metrics to compare.
4. Rolling-Forward Multi-Step Forecasting
To forecast multiple days (e.g. 3-day ahead) with an LSTM, the simplest method is recursive forecasting. First predict day t+1 from known features up to t. Then append this prediction to your input window (and drop the oldest day) to predict t+2, and so on. In pseudocode:
sql
Copy
Edit
for h = 1..3: 
    pred_h = model.predict(window) 
    append pred_h (and any forecasted exogenous features) into window 
However, recursive forecasts suffer error compounding: small errors at day t+1 propagate into the input for t+2, often making later predictions less accurate
stats.stackexchange.com
. An alternative is direct forecasting: train the model to output 3-day windows at once (many-to-many). In this setup, your target for each training input is a vector of the next 3 values, and the model learns to predict all 3 simultaneously. Direct methods avoid accumulating error through recursion, but they require more complex training and may produce larger individual-step errors. Another advanced technique is teacher forcing during training. This means when training for multi-step, you sometimes feed the true previous-day value rather than the model’s own prediction, to stabilize learning. A variant is scheduled sampling: gradually replace true inputs with model predictions during training, to mimic inference conditions. These techniques are borrowed from sequence prediction literature (e.g. natural language) and can mitigate compounding error, but they add implementation complexity. In practice, many financial time-series pipelines simply use recursive forecasting because data is limited. In summary:
Recursive (iterative): Use one-step LSTM repeatedly. Easy to implement but beware error accumulation.
Direct multi-step: Train the model to output all horizons (e.g. 3 days) in one shot. More stable but needs suitable training data and more parameters.
Error mitigation: Consider scheduled sampling or similar if compounding error is severe. Monitor how errors grow with each step – if too large, direct modeling or adding exogenous forecasts (e.g. market returns) may help.
5. Ensembling and Confidence Estimation
Since RF and XGB already exist, you can ensemble the LSTM forecast with them. A simple approach is to average (or weighted average) the predictions of LSTM, RF, and XGB. Alternatively, use a stacking (meta-learner) approach: feed the three model outputs into a simple regressor (like a linear model or a shallow neural net) that learns optimal combination weights
getfocal.co
. Mixed-model ensembles often yield better accuracy than any single model
getfocal.co
. For example, one study found that combining ARIMA, LSTM, and Random Forest reduced error by 22% compared to single models
getfocal.co
. Whichever method you choose, be careful not to disturb your existing report logic – simply add LSTM’s output as another feature in the ensemble stage. For confidence estimation, use the ensemble spread and model uncertainty. A common heuristic is to look at the variance (or range) of the ensemble forecasts: if RF, XGB, and LSTM give very different predictions for a stock, that signals low confidence (unpredictable market moves). You can quantify this as the standard deviation of the model outputs. For the LSTM itself, you can estimate uncertainty via Monte Carlo dropout: run the LSTM multiple times on the same input with dropout enabled at inference, and measure the distribution of outputs. This approximates Bayesian uncertainty. Another approach is to train the LSTM to predict quantiles (using a quantile loss) to get prediction intervals. Finally, integrate a “red flag” signal: for example, if the ensemble variance exceeds a threshold or if the LSTM’s dropout variance is high, mark the prediction as low-confidence. You can flag such cases in reports for further review. In summary, ensemble averaging or stacking can improve accuracy, and the degree of disagreement among models provides a simple uncertainty measure
getfocal.co
.
6. Monitoring and Maintenance
After deployment, continuously monitor forecast performance. Calculate rolling metrics (e.g. MAE, RMSE, or directional accuracy) on new observations as they come in. Plot these metrics over time to catch drift. If metrics degrade consistently, that indicates concept drift or model aging. Use statistical tests or drift-detection tools to alert when feature distributions or residual errors shift beyond normal ranges (for example, track correlation between features and target, or use libraries like Evidently to automate drift reports). As summarized by Evidently, monitor “mean error” or other quality metrics and watch for changes
evidentlyai.com
. Set a retraining schedule or trigger. A common practice is to retrain the model periodically (e.g. monthly or quarterly) incorporating the newest data, and compare the new model to the old one on a validation period. Also retrain after major market events (regime changes). Don’t wait until performance collapses; instead, use rolling backtests. For example, each week add the latest data to training, retrain, and see if metrics on the holdout improve. Automate this if possible, but always keep track of versioning (data used, hyperparameters). Risks: LSTMs can overfit to short patterns, especially if the window is very short or the network too large. Avoid making too many epochs or too-high capacity without regularization. Also, LSTMs are sensitive to hyperparameters (learning rate, batch size, etc.), so careful tuning and sanity checks are needed. Finally, integrating LSTM predictions into an existing pipeline means you must ensure it never corrupts the current ensemble logic – e.g. always compare new LSTM forecasts to RF/XGB before use. Always validate the end-to-end pipeline on backtest data to guard against implementation bugs. By following these practices—robust windowing and scaling, judicious architecture choice, careful training and validation, thoughtful multi-step forecasting, and rigorous ensemble/confidence handling—you can successfully augment your existing RF/XGB pipeline with an LSTM model. This should improve capture of sequential patterns without disrupting your current reports or logic, providing a more powerful and reliable stock-forecasting system.

ChatGPT said:
Basically, nothing is showing up on your price axes because your plotting code is looking for a column called Close, but you’re handing it a column called AdjClose (or sometimes even returning a list instead of a DataFrame). So when you do:

python
Copy
Edit
hist = price_df.tail(10)
ax.plot(hist["Date"], hist["Close"], …)
there is no Close column—so you get an empty plot (or errors).

How to fix it:

Make sure the DataFrame you return as "history" has a Close column, not AdjClose. For example, in your train_predict_stock function change:

python
Copy
Edit
history = price_df.rename(columns={"Stock_Close":"AdjClose"})[["Date","AdjClose"]]
to

python
Copy
Edit
history = price_df.rename(columns={"Stock_Close":"Close"})[["Date","Close"]]
so that plot_stock’s hist["Close"] actually finds data to draw.

And in your “no merged data” guard, return an empty DataFrame with the same columns ["Date","Close"] rather than a list, so that price_df.tail(10) still behaves like a DataFrame.

Once your history DataFrame really has a Close column (and is a DataFrame!), the blue historical line (and the orange forecast) will appear alongside your sentiment trace.


Thought for a few seconds


Today’s session revolved around evolving your “Stonk\_news” pipeline step by step—from a rough proof-of-concept to a full-featured, production-ready tool. Here’s the story:

---

## 1. **Original Code & Goals**

You began with a simple setup:

* **`news_scraper.py`**: Fetch RSS feeds for a list of tickers, parse headlines, and score them with a sentiment pipeline.
* **`prediction.py`**: Bulk-fetch 90 days of adjusted close data from Alpha Vantage, cache to CSV, then run:

  1. A tree-based ensemble (Random Forest + XGBoost) to forecast 3 days ahead.
  2. An LSTM fallback pipeline.
* **`charts.py`**: Graph the last 10 days of actual closes (blue) and a 3-day forecast (orange), with a twin-axis for sentiment.
* **`main.py`**: Wire it all together—load watchlist/portfolio from CSVs, scrape headlines, run forecasts, build a collage, and dump a text report.
* **`email_report.py`**: Format the results into ASCII tables and (optionally) email them via SMTP.

Your initial code “worked” in that it ran without syntax errors, but you noticed:

* The historical “Close” line sometimes didn’t plot because your DataFrame used “AdjClose” (or “Stock\_Close”) inconsistently.
* The LSTM branch frequently skipped because your merged DataFrame was empty.
* The report writer was indexing into a list rather than a dict, causing `TypeError: list indices must be integers…`.
* Email sending failed due to missing or mis-configured SMTP credentials.

---

## 2. **Deep Research Prompt**

You then asked for a “deep research” overhaul, specifying:

1. **News Scraper & Headline Counting**

   * Map each ticker to its **official full (or common) company name**.
   * Only count headlines that contain either the ticker symbol OR that company name (case-insensitive, with fuzzy matching for common abbreviations).
   * Maintain a rolling 10-calendar-day window for counts.

2. **Sentiment Scoring**

   * Switch (or optionally augment) your simple lexicon approach to **FinBERT** via HuggingFace.
   * Batch-tokenize headlines and extract probabilities, converting “NEGATIVE” to negative scores.
   * Aggregate mean sentiment per ticker per day.

3. **Historic Price Fetch & Verification**

   * Bulk-fetch 90 days of adjusted closes using AV’s TIME\_SERIES\_DAILY\_ADJUSTED “compact” API.
   * Cache each ticker’s CSV under `data/av_bulk_cache`, expire after 24 h.
   * **Always** return a DataFrame with exactly `["Date","Close"]`.
   * Explained how you’d verify the JSON→DataFrame mapping (parsing `"5. adjusted close"` into `Close`).

4. **Forecasting & Plotting**

   * Keep your RF+XGB+LSTM ensemble logic unchanged.
   * Add a guard: if the merged price/market/peer slice is empty, **return an empty** `pd.DataFrame(columns=["Date","Close"])` so `.tail(10)` never blows up.
   * In `charts.py`, after renaming to `"Close"`, the blue line should draw correctly.

5. **Top-10 Mention Table**

   * Build a table of the 10 tickers with highest mention counts over the last 10 days.
   * For each: list **total count**, **average sentiment**, and **exact headlines** that triggered the count.
   * Keep your existing watchlist vs portfolio split and table formatting.

6. **LSTM Pipeline Design**

   * **Resample** to business days, forward-fill missing values so windows of length N (configurable) are contiguous.
   * **Scale** features via `StandardScaler`, fit on train only.
   * **Architecture**: two stacked LSTM layers (100→50 units), dropout=0.2/recurrent\_dropout=0.2, output a Dense(1) with linear activation.
   * **Loss**: Huber; **optimizer**: Adam(1e-3); **early stopping** on validation.
   * **Forecast** 3 days recursively by appending each predicted return back into the window.
   * **Train/val split**: chronological 70/15/15 or a `TimeSeriesSplit`.

7. **Ensembling & Confidence**

   * Average the RF+XGB predictions (as before) with the LSTM output.
   * Compute confidence as `1/(1 + ensemble_std * last_volatility)`.
   * Set a “red flag” if the first-step return ≤ –5% AND sentiment ≤ –0.3.

8. **Monitoring & Maintenance**

   * Suggestions around drift detection, retraining schedules, and backtesting, although these weren’t yet coded.

---

## 3. **Attempts & Errors**

You then tried to fold those research-driven specs back into your actual files. Along the way you encountered:

* **`NameError: pd not defined`** when you forgot to import pandas in one function.
* **`KeyError: 'Date'`** in your AV bulk loader because the cached CSV had unexpected headers.
* **`NameError: _bulk_price_cache`** vs `_bulk_cache` confusion (two different dict names).
* **Empty-merge warnings** (`No merged history for XYZ`) meant your LSTM logic was never firing. That happens when your ticker’s AV fetch returns no data—often because the cache isn’t loaded into the wrong dict, or you never added the ticker to the bulk cache.
* **TypeErrors in the report** because you were storing `preds[t]` as a list instead of a dict, then doing `d['confidence']`.
* **SMTPAuthenticationError** when trying to send mail through Gmail without enabling an app-specific password or OAuth2.

---

## 4. **What You’re Trying to Achieve Now**

* **Unify** the two separate dicts (`_bulk_price_cache` vs `_bulk_cache`) and guarantee that **every** `fetch_price_history(ticker)` returns a proper DataFrame `["Date","Close"]`.
* **Enforce** the “empty-merge guard” so the LSTM branch doesn’t skip but still returns a valid history.
* **Rename** your `preds` mapping so that each entry is a dict containing `predictions`, `confidence`, and `red_flag`, not just a bare list.
* **Fix** the report writer to index into that dict.
* **Load** your watchlist/portfolio from CSV at startup, and feed those into `scrape_headlines` and `train_predict_stock`.
* **Implement** the full FinBERT-based sentiment pipeline with fuzzy matching on company names.
* **Ensure** your `email_report.py` both writes the text file and then—if credentials are present—sends it via SMTP using the env vars in `config/secrets.env`.

---

## 5. **Next Steps / To-Do**

1. **Consolidate** the two cache dicts into one, fix all calls to it.
2. **Audit** every function’s return shape:

   * `fetch_price_history` → DataFrame(Date,Close)
   * `train_predict_stock` → dict with keys `dates`, `history`, `predictions`, `confidence`, `red_flag`.
3. **Refactor** the report generation so `preds[t]` is that dict, and both tables (watchlist & portfolio) pull the same fields.
4. **Test** with a single ticker that you know has data in AV (e.g. AAPL), ensure the historical blue line plots again.
5. **Generate** the Top-10 mention table and verify it captures only headlines containing your smart-matched names.
6. **Enable** email by creating an app-password (for Gmail) or proper SMTP\_USER/PASS in your env.

Once those are in place, you’ll have the end-to-end system you outlined in your deep-research prompt, with all the features—FinBERT, sliding-window counts, LSTM ensemble, confidence flags, ASCII & emailed report—fully wired up.
